You will stop when you get to a list of length one, at which point you have to figure out how to put lists back together.  You need a little routine which goes through two ordered lists of arbitrary length and builds up the merged list from those two.  Given the recursion, you'll just work your way back up the list of recursions with ordered / merged lists. \n",
